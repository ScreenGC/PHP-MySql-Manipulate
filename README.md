# PHP-MySql-Manipulate

PHP to manage users of my [Loader](https://github.com/ScreenGC/Imgui-with-mysql-loader/tree/main)

If the user has "admin_grand", they will enter an admin panel. Otherwise, they will access a simple panel to activate their key or reset their HWID.

When logging into my loader, it will retrieve the user's IP and use it as the HWID system (I preferred this method due to spoofers).
